# 🏛️ The Foyer — CivicVerse Lobby City

> Think **Conton City** from *Xenoverse 2* meets **GTA Online** meets the **Sims** 
> But the lobby actually **does** something—and it’s **planned for Unreal Engine 5**.

Welcome to **The Foyer** — the immersive multiplayer lobby city where your **CivicWatch avatar** enters the CivicVerse. But this isn’t just a spawn zone—it’s a decentralized, living, evolving city that blends gaming, civic duty, and real-world infrastructure.

Planned for full deployment in **Unreal Engine 5**, The Foyer is a persistent, high-fidelity, civilian-owned multiplayer space—where **real-world actions shape digital reputation** and **digital identity unlocks real-world power**.

This isn't just another online game.

> 🎮 It invites indie devs, educators, and studios to **build immersive worlds** that matter.  
> 🌍 It’s changing video games for the first time since the leap to 3D.
